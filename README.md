# Navigo

Navigo makes searching for places quick and easy by adding drawing capabilities to the map. It makes finding rentals in a particular area or even searching for matching restaurants just a click away! The app is developed with **React.js**, routes managed with **React-Router** and **SASS** for styling. It uses the **Google Maps API** under the hood. It also supports **PWA** (Progressive Web App) capabilities, so it can be easily installed on mobile devices as well.
